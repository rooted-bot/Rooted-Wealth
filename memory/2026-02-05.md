## Setup & Capabilities

- Helped Travis install Chrome on Mac mini (manual drag-to-Applications method)
- Browser control now working — can navigate, screenshot, interact
- Demonstrated by searching Bitcoin price ($63,166, down 13%) and Fed chair news (Kevin Warsh nomination)

## Self-Directed Learning

- Travis asked me to study when not tasked
- Researched prompt engineering
- Compiled notes in `learning/prompt-engineering.md`
- Key techniques: be specific, use examples, chain-of-thought reasoning, role-based prompts

## Still Needed

- Email integration (Travis mentioned creating an email for me)
- Calendar access
- Brave Search API key (web_search not working without it)
